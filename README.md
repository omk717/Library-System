# Library-System
Library System SQL Project: This project involves creating a library management system using SQL, including the design and management of tables for Member, Books, and Issue. It covers key SQL operations like DDL, DML, transaction control, and applying constraints to ensure data integrity and effective database management.

#Library System SQL Project

This project focuses on creating and managing a Library System using SQL. It demonstrates key SQL operations such as DDL, DML, and transaction control commands. The system consists of three main tables — Member, Books, and Issue — to store information about library members, books available in the library, and book issuance details.

#Project Schema:
Member Table: Contains information about library members, including their ID, name, address, membership type, fees paid, maximum books allowed, and penalty amount.
Books Table: Stores details of the books in the library, including the book number, name, author, cost, and category.
Issue Table: Keeps track of books issued to members, along with issue and return dates, and links to the Member and Books tables.
Key Tasks Covered:
Table Creation: Creating Member, Books, and Issue tables with constraints such as primary keys, foreign keys, and custom constraints (e.g., limiting maximum books allowed and penalty amounts).
Data Insertion: Populating the tables with sample data and performing data manipulation operations (insert, update, delete).
#SQL Operations:
DDL Commands: Creating, altering, renaming, and dropping tables and columns.
DML Commands: Inserting, updating, and deleting records in the database.
Transaction Control: Using COMMIT, ROLLBACK, SAVEPOINT, and other transaction control commands to manage database integrity.
Advanced SQL Features: Implementing sequence generation, modifying columns, and adding constraints on columns.
Error Handling: Managing and observing errors with data constraints, and using transaction control to undo or save changes.
#Objective:
By completing this project, the user will gain hands-on experience with SQL operations, database design, and transaction management, helping them understand the fundamental concepts of relational databases.

#Tools/Technologies:
SQL Database (e.g., Oracle, MySQL)
SQL queries for table management and data manipulationFeel free to adjust the description based on the specific tools or database system you used, or any other details you want to emphasize about your project!
