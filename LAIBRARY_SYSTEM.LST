ðŸš€ SQL Project: Library Management System

I am excited to share my recent SQL project, where I designed and implemented a Library Management System using various SQL concepts. This project involved working with multiple tables to manage library data, such as books, members, and book issues.

Key Features of the Project:

ðŸ”¹ Database Schema: Created tables for members, books, and issue records with constraints.

ðŸ”¹ Data Manipulation: Inserted, updated, and deleted records with transactional control.

ðŸ”¹ SQL Operations: Utilized DDL, DML, and TCL commands like CREATE, ALTER, DROP, INSERT, UPDATE, COMMIT, ROLLBACK, and more.

ðŸ”¹ Data Integrity: Implemented primary and foreign keys, constraints like check and not-null, and handled data modifications using transactions.

ðŸ”¹ Advanced SQL: Applied SQL queries to generate reports, manage constraints, and optimize data management.

Project Overview:

The project was divided into multiple tasks, including:

Table creation with and without constraints.

Data insertion into various tables.

Transaction management (COMMIT, ROLLBACK, SAVEPOINT).

Foreign key constraints between tables.

Data modifications (updating records, handling errors, and constraints).

ðŸ”§ Technologies Used: SQL, Database Design, Oracle

A special thanks to my trainer Tejashri Fegade, for guiding me through this project and helping me enhance my SQL skills!
